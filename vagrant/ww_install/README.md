WeBWorK Install Script

The goal of the ww_install.pl script is to install webwork on any system that has the prerequisites
already installed. It's been lightly tested on

Fedora 17 (11/2012)

It's been moderately well tested on
Ubuntu 12.04 (11/2012, 6/2013)
Ubuntu 13.04 (6/2013)

On these systems it did in install webwork. If your system does not have all of the prerequisites installed,
then the install_prerequisites.sh script might help.  It will install many of the prerequisites on
systems based on Debian (Ubuntu,etc.), Red Hat Linux (Fedora, CentOS, Scientific Linux) and SUSE. We're working 
on getting it to install prereqs on other systems also, but for now other systems will need to have these 
prerequisites already installed.
